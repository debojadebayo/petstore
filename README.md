Here's a list of things I learned from this project:

- How to use the `createPortal` function to render a component into a different part of the DOM.
- How to use the `useRef` hook to create a reference to a DOM element.
- How to use the `useContext` hook to access the context object in a functional component.
- How to use the `useQuery` hook to fetch data from an API and manage the state of the query.

Aims to make it better

- Add pagination
- Use main API
